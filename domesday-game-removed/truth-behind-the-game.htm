		<p>Part of the great survey of landholding that was to become Domesday Book, involved describing how the land was used. If it was used for agriculture or animals, then the types and numbers of animal would often be recorded. Because each entry has been edited down less, Little Domesday contains greater description of animals than Great Domesday. You can read more about the survey in the <a href="/domesday/discover-domesday/default.htm">Discover Domesday exhibition</a>.</p>

<p>This description of how the land was used would give William an indication of the wealth of his kingdom, and how much tax he could raise. For us, it helps create a picture of the landscape. The village depicted in our game is fictional, but the settings for the five levels of the game are typical features of the landscape in 11th century England. You can read more about the landscape in the World of Domesday exhibition.</p>

<p>The animals from which you can score points – pigs, sheep, cattle, plough teams of oxen and deer – are recorded in Domesday. For instance, there are more than 80,000 references to plough teams in Domesday. Foxes are not recorded, which is why you do not score points by clicking on them!</p>
