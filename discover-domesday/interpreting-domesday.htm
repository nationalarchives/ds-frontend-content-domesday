			<h2 class="no-border">Reading Domesday entries</h2>
		<p>Domesday is written in a heavily abbreviated Latin with small marks to show where a letter or letters have been left out, to save space. This is rather like today where we write &lsquo;won&rsquo;t&rsquo; as an abbreviation for &lsquo;will not&rsquo;. </p>    
	
		<p>This is the Domesday entry for one of the <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#manor">manors</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> of Earley, near Reading in Berkshire.  We read that in 1086 it was held directly by the King.  Another neighbouring manor, also called Earley, was held by a <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#normandy">Norman</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> tenant of the King, Osbern Giffard.</p>

		<p>The following is an expanded translation (Domesday words directly translated in bold) of the entry for the royal manor of Earley, Berkshire:</p>  
		
        <div class="clearing"></div>
		
        <p><strong>The King</strong> (William) <strong>holds in demesne Earley</strong> (in lordship &ndash; that is, by and for himself; he has not let it out to a sub-tenant).   <strong>Almar</strong> (an Anglo-Saxon) <strong>held it in alod</strong> (freehold) <strong>from King Edward</strong>.   <strong>Then</strong> (in 1066, it was assessed for tax purposes) <strong>at 5 hides, now</strong> (in 1086 it is assessed)<strong> for</strong> (the equivalent of) <strong>4 hides</strong>.   (There is) <strong>Land for use by 6 ploughs</strong>.  <strong>In demesne</strong> (on the lord&rsquo;s land there is land for) <strong>1 plough and</strong> (there are) <strong>6 villans</strong> (villagers) <strong>and 1 bordar</strong> (smallholder) <strong>with 3 ploughs</strong>.  <strong>There</strong> (are) <strong>2 slaves</strong> (owned by the King) <strong>and 1 site</strong> (or close) <strong>in Reading</strong> (presumably owned by or part of the manor) <strong>and</strong> (there are) <strong>2 fisheries worth</strong> (rendering) <strong>7s and 6d</strong> (per year) <strong>and 20 acres of meadow</strong>.  (There is) <strong>Woodland for</strong> (feeding) <strong>70 pigs</strong>.
        <strong>At the time of King Edward</strong> (1066) <strong>it was worth 100s, and afterwards</strong> (when William acquired the manor) <strong>and now</strong> (1086) <strong>it is worth 50s</strong>.</p> 
		
		<h2>Insight into society</h2>
		
        <p>Domesday Book reveals an elaborate feudal structure of landholding from the King down. Under the <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/order.htm">feudal system</a> land was supposedly held directly or indirectly from the King who stood at the top of the feudal ladder. The King granted land called <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#fief">fiefs</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> to the <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#tenant">tenants-in-chief</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> beneath him - his chief barons, bishops and abbots. This was partly as a reward for helping him to conquer the kingdom, partly to keep their loyalty, and partly to ensure that certain difficult geographical areas were being securely held for him. In return he received their loyalty and service. This service usually came in the form of supplying the King with a number of men-at-arms and <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#knight">knights</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> for a specific period should he wish to raise an army. In turn the barons could parcel out the land given to them to their own sub-tenants who likewise owed them loyalty and service &ndash; again usually military. Domesday is thus more than a legal and fiscal document. It is also a feudal record in which the description of the land follows the <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#feudal">feudal</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> hierarchy. </p>

		<div class="img-wrapper">
			  <img src="/domesday/images/ladder.gif" title="The social hierarchy with the King at the top" alt="The social hierarchy with the King at the top" width="240" height="438" />
			  <div class="img-description">The social hierarchy with the King at the top.  Under the feudal system he granted lands to his tenants-in-chief below in return for various services, usually military.  The tenants-in-chief likewise granted lands to their tenants (sub-tenants).</div>
		  </div>

	  
		<p>Apart from the feudal structure Domesday also gives the</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Names of landholders in each county</li>
		<li>Manors which they held and their values</li>
		<li>Names of their sub-tenants</li>
		<li>Names of many <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#borough">boroughs</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> and details of their customs</li>
		<li>Number of <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#freemen">freemen</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" />, <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#sokeman">sokemen</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" />, unfree peasants and <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#slave">slaves</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> on each manor</li>
		<li>Resources of each <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#manor">manor</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>By analysing the vast amounts of information we discover that in 1086 that:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>The King and his family held 17% of the land</li>
		<li>The bishops and abbots held 26% of the land</li>
		<li>Around 190 lay  tenants held about 54% of the land </li>
		<li>Of the lay tenants, 12 or so leading barons controlled almost a quarter of the land</li>
		<li>There were only two <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#anglosaxon">Anglo-Saxon</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> tenants-in-chief: Thorkhill of Arden and Coleswain of Lincoln with large estates</li>
		<li>The two most important women mentioned, Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s widow and William&rsquo;s queen, were both dead</li>
		<li>The most prominent living woman was Countess Judith, a niece of King  William</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Domesday Book provides details of:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>13,418 places</li>
		<li>48 <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/nobles.htm">castles</a> including Windsor</li>
		<li>112 <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/towns.htm">boroughs</a></li>
		<li>Over 60 major <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/church.htm">religious houses </a></li>
		<li>Over 300 parish <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/church.htm">churches</a></li>
		<li>Around 6,000 mills (but no windmills)</li> 
		<li>About 45 vineyards</li> 
		<li>Various <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/landscape.htm">woodlands</a></li>
		<li>Numerous <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/king.htm">markets</a></li>
		<li>Several <a href="/domesday/world-of-domesday/king.htm">mints</a></li>
		<li>Inland and coastal fisheries </li>
		<li>And some industry including salt pans, lead working, quarries and potteries </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>By comparing the information in Domesday relating to 1066 and 1086 we can gauge the impact of the Norman conquest in such areas as:</p>	
        
        <div class="img-wrapper">
				  <img src="/domesday/images/fig16-woodland.jpg" title="Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry &ndash; 11th  century; by special permission of the City of Bayeux" alt="Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry &ndash; 11th  century; by special permission of the City of Bayeux" width="470" height="500" />
				  <div class="img-description content-image">Woodland was valuable for hunting game, as swine pasture and for felling timber.  Detail of the Bayeux Tapestry &ndash; 11th  century; by special permission of the City of Bayeux</div>
				</div>
  

		<ul>
		<li>The replacement of Anglo-Saxon ruling groups by a new aristocracy of Frenchmen, Normans and <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#breton">Bretons</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> </li>
		<li>The reordering of society along feudal lines constituting a tenurial revolution </li>
		<li>A building programme of castles, cathedrals, abbeys and lesser churches in which many houses were destroyed to make way for castles that lead to local decline and oppression</li> 
		<li>The varying fortunes of places like Dunwich in Suffolk where Domesday shows that the village lost half its farmland to sea erosion between 1066 and 1086</li>
		</ul>
        
         <div class="clearing"></div>	

		<p>Domesday often provides fascinating insights into local customs and laws giving us a rare picture of everyday life in late 11th century England.  For example, in: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Chester if you killed a man on a holy day you paid a fine of £4 but on other days 40s</li>
		<li>Wallingford, Berkshire, before the Norman conquest if the King sent an army out, 1 <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#thegn">thegn</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> (nobleman) was sent from every 5 <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#hide">hides</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" /> to attend him</li>
		<li>Oakley, Buckinghamshire, Aelfgyth the maid had been granted half a hide by Godric the sheriff as long as she taught his daughter gold embroidery</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Domesday descendants</h2>
		<p>Domesday Book is not a census and does not contain the names of everyone living in late 11th century England.  Although Domesday contains many thousands of names it is probable that only two families can, with any certainty, trace their lineage back in the male line to an Anglo-Saxon forebear mentioned in Domesday. Anglo-Norman ancestors who held large estates and are often given surnames in Domesday are easier to trace. But even here the problem remains that between 1086 and 1154, the date of the first continuous series of <a href="/domesday/glossary/default.htm#publicrecord">public records</a><img src="/images/icons/glossarylink.gif" alt="glossary icon" />, there is a gap in the archives. For more information consult A.J. Camp, <em>They Came with the Conqueror</em> (Society of Genealogists, 1990).</p>
